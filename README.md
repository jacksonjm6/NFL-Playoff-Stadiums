# NFL-Playoff-Stadiums

For my lab assignment, we were tasked with creating an interactive chloropleth map or an interactive proportional symbol map. I chose to make a proporsional symbol map, highlighting the stadiums of all 14 NFL teams who made the playoffs in the 2023/24 season. Despite some games not being played in these stadiums such as the Pittsburgh Steelers not hosting or playing in Acrisure, the stadium was still included as the Steelers made the postseason. 

This map features a data set, courtesy of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kayla96/nfl-teams-data, which gave me the stadium names and latitude and longitude data. I also used the following wikipedia site, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums, which gave me updated names and my preferred data set, stadium occupancy. The stadium occupancy is supposed to be the range that changes the symbol sizes, despite having plenty of errors and issues, with displaying my code on the map.
